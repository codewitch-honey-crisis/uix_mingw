# uix_mingw

A rough port of the UIX benchmark example to Windows and DirectX

To build the project you'll need mingw. I use GCC 13 or above but earlier versions *might* choke.

Make a "lib" folder in the project directory.
Run fetch_deps.cmd to get all of the dependencies.
Use the CMake extension to Build All Projects on the root CMakeLists.txt
Use the run.cmd to run the project
